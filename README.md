## Introduction

42SP-PushSwap is a sorting algorithm project that aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm that can sort the stack with the minimum number of moves.

The project involves two stacks, named Stack A and Stack B. Initially, Stack A contains a random list of integers, and Stack B is empty. The task is to sort the integers in Stack A in ascending order using a set of predefined operations, such as swapping, pushing, and rotating elements between the stacks.

The project challenges your algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to optimize the sorting process. It requires careful planning and implementation of the sorting algorithm to minimize the number of moves and achieve the desired result.

## Rules

The rules for the PushSwap project are as follows:

1. The game is played with two stacks, A and B.
2. Initially, Stack A contains a random list of unique integers, and Stack B is empty.
3. The goal is to sort the integers in Stack A in ascending order.
4. Only the following operations are allowed:
   - `sa`: swap the first two elements of Stack A.
   - `sb`: swap the first two elements of Stack B.
   - `ss`: swap the first two elements of both stacks.
   - `pa`: push the first element of Stack B to Stack A.
   - `pb`: push the first element of Stack A to Stack B.
   - `ra`: rotate all elements of Stack A up by one.
   - `rb`: rotate all elements of Stack B up by one.
   - `rr`: rotate all elements of both stacks up by one.
   - `rra`: rotate all elements of Stack A down by one.
   - `rrb`: rotate all elements of Stack B down by one.
   - `rrr`: rotate all elements of both stacks down by one.
5. The program must output a list of the operations performed to sort Stack A.

## Usage

To use the PushSwap program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/maidell/42SP-PushSwap.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd 42SP-PushSwap
```


3. Compile the program using the Makefile:

```shell
make
```


4. Run the program with a list of integers as arguments:

```shell
./push_swap 3 2 1
```


Replace `3 2 1` with your own list of integers.

5. The program will output a list of operations to sort the stack. You can also use the `checker` program to validate the sorting:


```shell
./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker 3 2 1
```


Replace `3 2 1` with the same list of integers used for the `push_swap` program.

Feel free to explore the project, review the implementation, and test the program with different sets of integers.
